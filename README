This is an implementation of JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber's PowerPlay[1] architecture for
'Universal Artificial Intelligence', implemented in the dependently-typed language
Coq[2]. Using a system like Coq gives us two things:

 * The PowerPlay implementation is formally verified
 * We can build PowerPlay's proof machinery on top of Coq's

Specifications for several variants of the PowerPlay architecture can be found
in Arch.v.
